      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm currently focused on machine learning systems work that bridges research and production. On the research side, I've explored watermarking and distillation for language models, as well as reinforcement learning pipelines that make agents more robust and cost efficient. On the product side, I like building reliable ETL, clean interfaces, and evaluation harnesses that reveal whether a model genuinely improves the experience for users. I prefer simple, explainable approaches first, then add complexity only where it clearly pays off.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy small creative projects: visualizing daily data, building single‑file web apps, and writing short notes that clarify a tricky idea. These help me ship quickly, get feedback, and iterate. I’m also comfortable across the stack—Python for data and services, JavaScript for front ends, and just enough ops to keep things running.</p>
      <p>On this site you’ll find a curated selection of projects, a one‑page resume, and simple ways to contact me. If you’re exploring a collaboration or want feedback on an idea, I’m happy to chat. I value teams that are kind, direct, and focused on measurable outcomes. The rest of this page highlights a few areas I care about and how I work.</p>
