      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Aru and I’m a student at Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business, where I’m pursuing a combined degree in Mathematics and Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and a minor in Data Science. I’ve always loved numbers and problem-solving, and I’m drawn to the intersection of math, markets, and technology.
Over the past few years, I’ve worked in both investment and analytical roles at firms like Sun Life Capital Management, AllianceBernstein, and Workiva. I’ve built financial models, performed credit analysis, and developed derivatives trading algorithms that have helped the firms I’ve worked for make thousands of dollars. This upcoming January, I’ll be joining Scotiabank as a Fixed Income Sales & Trading Co-op in the Structured Solutions Group, where I’ll continue learning about structuring more niche and complicated derivatives products.
At Northeastern, I am currently the President of Bull & Bear Research Club, mentoring around 40 other students through equity research projects and valuation work across a variety of subsectors. Outside of school, I really enjoy traveling, poker nights, snowboarding, and finding new food spots around Boston.
I’m always open to new opportunities that bring together finance, markets, and mathematical applications, and to meet people who are just as excited about learning as I am.
